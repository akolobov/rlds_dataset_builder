PLEX robosuite dataset contains demonstrations for 6 tasks from the simulated [robosuite](https://robosuite.ai/) environment: `Door`, `Stack`, `NutAssemblyRound`, `PickPlaceMilk`, `PickPlaceBread`, and `PickPlaceCereal`. It contains `75` demonstrations per task, all successful, collected using [robosuite\'s keyboard interface](https://robosuite.ai/docs/algorithms/demonstrations.html) on a `Panda` robot driven via an [OSC_POSE controller](https://robosuite.ai/docs/modules/controllers.html). It is complimentary to the [robomimic](https://robomimic.github.io/) and [LIBERO](https://libero-project.github.io/main.html )datasetS, which provide demonstrations for different `robosuite` tasks.

This dataset version was rendered from the original raw demonstrations available on [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=105664) at `128x128` resolution. These raw demonstrations can be rendered at other resolutions and with other camera view by modifying the `args` variable in [this script](https://github.com/microsoft/PLEX/blob/main/scripts/setup_robosuite_data_for_PLEX.py). Originally, the demonstrations in this dataset were collected and used for the experiments in the [CoRL-2023 PLEX paper](https://microsoft.github.io/PLEX/).
